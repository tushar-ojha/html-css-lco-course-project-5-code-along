## Learnings from the project:-
    - images behave like inline-block element though inspect window says image is an inline element.
    - Input fields are inline element. 
    - To make any inline element block or to do \n, we can wrap things in div.
    - "Confirm Password/ Confirm account number" usually has type text!
    - font-size in input property bumps up the size of input area.
